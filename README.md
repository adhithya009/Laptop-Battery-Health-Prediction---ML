Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the health and degradation of a laptop battery using machine learning techniques. The prediction is based on key usage and operational parameters such as daily usage duration, charging cycles, and related factors. 
The model evaluates the current condition of the battery, identifies potential failure risks, and provides actionable insights to extend battery lifespan.
In addition to health prediction, the system performs fault analysis and generates usage-based recommendations to encourage healthier laptop usage habits and reduce long-term battery degradation.
The proposed solution employs a combination of regression models, classification techniques, and simple neural networks to analyze battery behavior and degradation trends.

Key Features
•	Battery Failure Prediction and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Estimation
Predicts whether a battery is likely to fail and estimates the number of days remaining before failure, if applicable.
•	Explainable Failure Analysis
Provides insights into the primary factors contributing to battery degradation, enabling interpretability of model decisions.
•	What-If Simulation and Recommendation System
Simulates alternative usage scenarios and recommends optimized laptop usage patterns to improve battery longevity.
